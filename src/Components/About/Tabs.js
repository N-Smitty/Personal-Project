        You can’t mistake a Bulldog for any other breed. The loose skin of the
        head, furrowed brow, pushed-in nose, small ears, undershot jaw with
        hanging chops on either side, and the distinctive rolling gait all
        practically scream “I’m a Bulldog!” The coat, seen in a variety of
        colors and patterns, is short, smooth, and glossy. Bulldogs can weigh up
        to 50 pounds, but that won’t stop them from curling up in your lap, or
        at least trying to. But don’t mistake their easygoing ways for
        laziness—Bulldogs enjoy brisk walks and need regular moderate exercise,
        along with a careful diet, to stay trim. Summer afternoons are best
        spent in an air-conditioned room as a Bulldog’s short snout can cause
        labored breathing in hot and humid weather. You can’t mistake a Bulldog
